#A Kinect Audio Visual Installation
This is a collaboration between [Terry Clark](http://www.terrylewisclark.me) and Gustaf Svenungsson.

Our aim was to create an interactive audiovisual installation using the a 3D Camera and an audio recording software to manipulate sounds.

We use skeleton data from the Kinect and SimpleOpen NI in order to capture hand vectors to create gestuers which change track forward and backwards, stop/play and go into "repeater mode". We also have different interactions in each Ableton scene to control different instruments and devices on those instruments.

Blog coming soon for more info and video.
